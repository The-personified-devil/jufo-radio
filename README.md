# jufo-radio

The goal of this project is to digitalize an old radio.

Notes:

   The submodules link to the Github mirrors of the Videolan repositories, because Github isn't able to link to Gitlab repositories.

   The main Videolan repositories are listed below:
      * VLC-3.0 - https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-3.0
      * libVLCpp - https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlcpp

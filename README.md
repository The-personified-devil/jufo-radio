# jufo-radio

The goal of this project is to digitalize an old radio and present the project at the "Jugend Forscht" science fair.

Because of this I will not be accepting pull requests etc.
In the offchance that you still have a suggestion or an objection about the source code, please make your voice heard via github discussions

## Notes

The submodules link to the Github mirrors of the Videolan repositories, because Github isn't able to link to Gitlab repositories.

The main Videolan repositories are listed below:

* VLC-3.0 - https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-3.0
* libVLCpp - https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlcpp
